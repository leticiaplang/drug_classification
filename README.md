### Content & access
* This educational project was designed for classification model construction
* The original dataset can be find at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/prathamtripathi/drug-classification)
* You can access the original code by:
    - After openning it at GitHub, click on 'open in colab'
    - Make a Raw copy and save it in .ipynb format
    - Open it with https link

### Business problem
One of the biggest pain at healthcare services is the medication and prescription errors. According Rayhan A. and collegue's [article](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK519065/) the ordering/prescribing errors include 50% of the total medications errors. It's harms not only the patient, familly and professionals, as the company, once it's esteemed an bigger cost of $40 billion each year to look after these patients.
This algorithm is the first step to construct an MVP looking for help at secure medication presciption. After that we are going analyse dosage data and a bigger sample for better results.

### Goals
* Looking for insigths about association e correlation between variables at exploratory analysis
* Construct classification model to predict which drug is prescripted
